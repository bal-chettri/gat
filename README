README:

gat/masm85 is an educational purpose assembler project that demonstrates how an assembler can be implemented.

Features:

- gat(generic assembler toolkit) as a backend for the assembler provides generic code like parsing, scanning etc.

- masm85: Full implementation and front-end for Intel 8085A micro processor.

- Addditional frondends could be possibly added for other machine architectures.

- Implemented in C language without any external libraries.

The choice of 8085A processor is for simplicity.

How to Build on Windows:

- Visual Studio 10 project file is available under builds/vs_2010 folder. Open gat.sln and build. Building the project generates masm85.exe under bin folder.

- Optionally, to build from command line, goto builds/vs_2010 directory and type MSBuild.

  C:\...builds\vs_2010> MSBuild

  masm85.exe will be generated under bin folder.

How to build on other platforms like Linux/Mac/cygwin:

- For other platforms you need gcc and make tools to build. From the project's root folder, type 'make'. or 'make masm85' to build. Ouput will be generated under bin folder.

How to Test:

Once you have build the assembler, you can test it using sample source file test.asm provided under tests/ folder.

$ ./bin/masm85

masm85 - micro assembler for Intel 8085 micro processor
Version : 0.0.1

Usage: masm85 [<input-path>] [options]

Options:
  [-hex | -85]               : generate HEX or 85 file (default is -hex)
  [-o<output-path>]          : specify output file path
  [-dbg[<debug-ouput-path>]] : generate debug DBG file
  
To assemble the source file in HEX format type:

$ ./bin/masm85.exe ./tests/test.asm -hex
scanning ./tests/test.asm
assembling ./tests/test.asm
written 8 bytes to ./tests/test.hex
0 error(s) 0 warning(s)

To assemble the source file in binary format type:

$ ./bin/masm85.exe ./tests/test.asm -85
scanning ./tests/test.asm
assembling ./tests/test.asm
written 8 bytes to ./tests/test.85
0 error(s) 0 warning(s)
